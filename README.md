## Design

### Colour Scheme

I have used an image to cover the whole site, as a background. The background image displays food in a clean way and has many colours in it. The colours displayed on the website are vibrant and eye-catching while ensuring a seamless experience for the user.



### Typography
  - There are three fonts used throughout the page:
 1. example
 2. example
 3. example

### Imagery

As the quiz is about food, I have added a picture of neatly arranged food to the background of the page so that the user knows what the quiz is about. 

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

#### Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

### Accessibility

During programming, I made sure that the website is as barrier-free as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using a hover state for all buttons on the website to make it clear to the user whether they are hovering over a button.
* Choose a sans serif font for the website - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.
* Ensure sufficient colour contrast throughout the website.

### Solved Bugs

| No | Bug | How I solved the issue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | Flashing occurs when refreshing the page (once in a while) | Tried to prevent it by using JavaScript and the 'onload' event of the image to trigger actions once the image is fully loaded. However, with help from John on tutoring team. We agreed on changing fallback color to be more white/grey would be the easiest option, as the flashing won't be so obvious. |
| 2 | Answer buttons (for the quiz) don't function correctly | Forgot to add closing div for game, after adding it. Everything worked fine|
| 3 | Score not counting | To solve this issue, I corrected the option attribute to match the index of the correct answer (It was previously set to 1,2,3,4 in HTML. Now it's changed starting from 0, which matches the index of the answers in Javascript). I also added '===' instead of '==' to ensure strics equality |
| 4 | Red/green colors don't display correctly for correct/incorrect answers | To ensure correctness, I compared the text content of the selected option (selectedAnswer) with the text content of the correct answer (currentQuestion.options[currentQuestion.answer]). I used the find method to search for the correct answer by comparing the text content of each option with the text content of the correct answer. After making these changes, the function now handles both correct and incorrect responses|
| 5 | After quiz completion, user is asked to submit name to log score. Problem with storing data of name submitted | Solved it by storing an if statement checking if local storage is empty versus not empty, using JSON string to parse into javascript array. |
| 6 | Clicking on submit button but instead of showing name and score, I get redirected back to the quiz | Run the console.log in Devtools and saw an error of a variable that I'm trying to access the 'style' property of is null. Added an ID of that variable back in HTML, after checking the console log again and testing the submit button. I now see the name and the score displaying. |

### Known Bugs

* Flashing occurs when refreshing the page (once in a while, not every time). Since it's not affecting the overall user experience, I decided to just change the fallback color to be more white/grey (was previous orange, which was not so smooth).
