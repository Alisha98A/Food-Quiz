## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals
* **User story 1: As someone new to the site**

* I'm eager to engage in an engaging online food quiz to broaden my culinary knowledge. I seek the convenience of being able to participate from anywhere, at any time.
* Clear and concise instructions on how to play the game are essential to me.
* I expect the website to adapt seamlessly to my device.
* Navigating through the website should be intuitive and straightforward.

#### Returning Visitor Goals
* **User story 2: As a returning visitor**

* I would like to have the option of choosing a difficulty level that matches my experience, which I will assess when I first interact with the website.

#### Frequent Visitor Goals
* **User story 3: Being a regular user of the platform**

* I'm enthusiastic about sharing my feedback on the gaming experience through a straightforward and user-friendly form. I anticipate that my suggestions and reported issues will be considered for future updates, enhancing the quality of the quiz game.
* Tracking my scores over time is important to me, allowing me to monitor my performance and progress.
* I desire the ability to effortlessly share my results on various social media platforms, adding to the enjoyment of the experience.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

I have used an image to cover the whole site, as a background. The background image displays food in a clean way and has many colours in it. The colours displayed on the website are vibrant and eye-catching while ensuring a seamless experience for the user.



### Typography
  - There are three fonts used throughout the page:
 1. example
 2. example
 3. example

### Imagery

As the quiz is about food, I have added a picture of neatly arranged food to the background of the page so that the user knows what the quiz is about. 

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet and desktop using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/)

#### Future Implementations

In future implementations I would like to:

### Accessibility

During programming, I made sure that the website is as barrier-free as possible. I have achieved this by:

* Using semantic HTML.
* Using a hover state for all buttons on the website to make it clear to the user whether they are hovering over a button.
* Choose a sans serif font for the website - these fonts are suitable for people with dyslexia.
* Ensure sufficient colour contrast throughout the website.

BELOW IS EARLIER CONTENT

![CI logo](https://codeinstitute.s3.amazonaws.com/fullstack/ci_logo_small.png)

Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for Codeanywhere. If you are using Gitpod then you need [this template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) instead.  We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Codeanywhere and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **August 30th, 2023**

## Codeanywhere Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Codeanywhere with no-cache, you can use this alias for `python3 -m http.server`.

`http_server`

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A button should appear to click: _Open Preview_ or _Open Browser_.

In Codeanywhere you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to _Account Settings_ in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the _API Key_ and click _Reveal_
3. Copy the key
4. In Codeanywhere, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

---

Happy coding!
